# Angular Firebase â€¢ Kanban Board

![alt text](/readme_assets/kanban-demo.gif "Website demo")

Portfolio project that allows users to login and create their own boards with cards to follow Agile development methodology.

## Technologies Used

- Angular 8.x
- Firebase
- Angular Material

## Notable Features

The goal of the project was to learn Angular and incorporate CRUD operations using Firebase as backend.

- Create new boards/cards
- Delete existing boards/cards
- Reorder existing boards/cards
- Login/register via email/google/anonymous
- Guard unauthorised users from accessing boards

### CRUD operations

You are able to interact with the application by:

- Creating new boards and tasks
- Removing boards and tasks
- Updating your tasks and assigning different colors to them

### Drag Drop

Drag and drop in order to organize your boards and cards.

### Login

The app allows you to login or register in multiple ways:

- Google Login
- Email Login
- Anonymous Session Login

If you choose to register and login via email then you can also reset your password in case you forget it.

### Cloud Save

Your files are saved on the cloud using Firebase Firestore. This also allowed me to implement CRUD operations using Firebase as the backend.
